                <h2> Checkers </h2>
                
                Growing up checkers was one of my favorite games to play. <br>
                It was also one of my first projects to create. <br>
                Checkers is a board game played by two persons who oppose each other <br>
                across a board of 64 light and dark squares. The 24 playing pieces are <br>
                disk-shaped and of contrasting colors(black and white). Play consists of <br>
                advancing a piece diagonally forward to an adjoining vacant square. Black moves first. <br>
                If an opponent’s piece is in such an adjoining vacant square, with a vacant space beyond, <br>
                it must be captured and removed by jumping over it to the empty square. <br> 
                If this square presents the same situation, successive jumps forward in a <br> 
                straight or zigzag direction must be completed in the same play. <br> 
                When there is more than one way to jump, the player has a choice. <br> 
                When a piece first enters the king row, the opponent’s back row, <br> 
                it must be crowned by the opponent, who places another piece of the same colour on it. <br>
                The piece, now called a king, has the added privilege of moving and jumping backward; <br> 
                if it moved to the last row with a capture, it must continue capturing backward if possible. <br> 
                A win is scored when an opponent’s pieces are all captured or blocked so that they cannot move. <br> 
                When neither side can force a victory and the trend of play becomes repetitious, a draw game is declared. <br>

                <h3> Python Programming Tutoring</h3>
                
                    Before enrolling to college, I took a gap year to explore life and <br>
                    really look for what I like. During this time, I offered to volunteer <br>
                    at a local primary school to teach children basic skills in Computer Science. <br>
                    I trained the kids on basic python fundamentals. At the end of my volunteering period, <br>
                    the kids were able to create simple games such as tic tac toe and hangman using <br>
                    using python. After coming to the states for studies, I realized how important <br>
                    it is for young children to have the opportunity to learn and practise skills <br>
                    from a young age. I started trying to develop a curriculum that would enable <br>
                    children from developing nations to have access to coding training programs. <br>
                    Even though this has made quite insignificant progress, I am hopefull for a breakthrough <br>
                    soon.
